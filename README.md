## Basic Routing

1. Create two routes named "about" and "contact".

2. Verify that you can navigate between the "about," and "contact" pages.

## Nested Routing

1. Create a "products" route and inside that same folder create two more folders name "allproducts" & "specificproduct"
2. Inside the "allproducts" folder create a component which will show this text: "(1220) products in the store"
3. Inside the "specificproduct" folder create a component which will show this text: "Here is my one & only product"
4. Test all the routs.
